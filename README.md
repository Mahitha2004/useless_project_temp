## Basic Details

### Project Description
It's an AI-powered web app that acts as a "weather forecast" for your bananas. You upload a photo of a banana, and the application uses computer vision to identify its ripeness (green, yellow, or spotted). It then generates a fun, detailed report predicting when it will be perfect to eat and when it will be ideal for banana bread, complete with interactive visuals.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Find forecast of Banana's ripeness
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
By mentioning the colour we can predict it's rippening time.
